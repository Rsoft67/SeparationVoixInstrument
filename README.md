# Audio Source Separation using Frequency Analysis and AI

This project explores the challenge of **separating a specific sound source (voice or object sound) from an audio signal** using Python.  
The approach combines both **mathematical frequency-domain analysis** and **machine learning techniques** to evaluate performance.

### Methodology
1. **Frequency-based approach**  
   - Applied mathematical transformations (e.g., Fourier Transform, spectrogram analysis) to isolate frequency bands.  
   - Attempted to separate the target sound source from background noise using signal processing techniques.  
   - The detailed mathematical reasoning and derivations are documented in a dedicated Google Doc.  

2. **AI-based approach**  
   - Collected and preprocessed audio data for supervised training.  
   - Implemented and trained a neural network to perform source separation.  
   - Compared the AI modelâ€™s results with the purely frequency-based method.  

### Objectives
- Understand the **strengths and limitations of classical frequency analysis** for audio source separation.  
- Evaluate how **AI models can improve separation quality** compared to purely mathematical methods.  
- Provide a comparative study between both approaches based on performance metrics (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, accuracy, clarity).
